# home_app
The main purpose of this app is to help me and my girlfriend orginalize our household expenses and "life" in an easy way. The app is an "MVP" for now and is live in production. For now there is only an expense module, which is enough, but there are plans for new ones, which will be added in free time. In the near future I want to restructure the api into a microservice architecture, as there are only two services (auth and expenses) so it is still easy to do. I would like to do this because of my interests and to increase my knowledge of microservices architecture. There is already a one new service waiting ready for integration [Ai-recipies-maker](https://github.com/oxygensend/ai-recipes-maker).
